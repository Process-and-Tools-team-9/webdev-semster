# Office Calendar and Event Application 

## Description
The Office Calendar and Event application is designed to streamline event management and employee status tracking within an organization. 
There are *two types of users*: **admins** and **employees**. 
- **Admins** have access to a dashboard where they can create events and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on them. Admins can also view who is attending events, access event ratings and feedback from past events, and filter events based on specific criteria.

- **Employees** can log in to view upcoming events and indicate their interest in attending future events. They can also provide feedback and ratings for events they have attended. Additionally, employees can indicate their working statusâ€”whether they are on-premises, working from home, or away. This status is visible to their peers, allowing everyone to see who is available in the office on a given day or time.

- **Extra** To enhance the application further, several exciting features could be included: 
    - a notification system for event reminders and status updates, 
    - real-time updates using WebSockets or SignalR, 
    - an analytics dashboard for admins to view event attendance and feedback trends, 
    - event categorization for easier filtering and searching, 
    - integration with external calendars like Google Calendar and Outlook, 
    - user profile pages for employees to manage their information, 
    - an event invitation system to send and track RSVPs, 
    - and full mobile responsiveness to ensure a seamless experience on any device.

# Diagrams

## ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram)

- User (UserID, Name, Email, PasswordHash, Role)
- Event (EventID, Title, Description, Date, Location, CreatedBy)
- EmployeeStatus (StatusID, UserID, Date, Status)

- Attendance (AttendanceID, EventID, UserID, Status)
- Feedback (FeedbackID, EventID, UserID, Rating, Comments)
- -*OR* -
- EventResponse (ResponseID, EventID, UserID, Rating, Comments)
* It could be a database design choice to have either EventResponse as 1 table to record the attendance and feedback or use two tables as above.

## Use Case Diagram

- **Admin:** Manage Events, View Attendees, View Feedback, Filter Events
- **Employee:** View Events, Attend Events, Give Feedback, Set Status, View Peer Status
- *both users Admin and Employee have common use of login etc*
