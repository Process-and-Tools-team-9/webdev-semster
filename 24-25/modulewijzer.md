    - 2 X 15 hours of Lesson.
    - 3 X 15 hours of practice.
    - 2 x 15 hours of project
    - variable amount of time for workshops (if and as needed)
    - the rest is self-study 

- **Examination:** Two types of assessments, Project based assessment, and Exam based assessment  *double check for academic honesty* 
- **Course structure:** Lectures, self-study, practical exercises and project.
- **Prerequisite knowledge:** Successful completion of 1st year.
- **Learning materials:**
  - **Book:** Unfortunately there is no specific book sufficient enough to cover all the topics.
  - **Readers & Exercises** reader and exercises provided in teams/github/lms, 
- **Connected to competences:** See realiseren en ontwerpen
- **Learning objectives:** At the end of the course, the student will be able to:
  1. Design and develop RESTful Web APIs using .NET Core, emphasizing the implementation of **endpoints**, request/response handling to facilitate communication between the client and server.
  2. Gain proficiency in utilizing .NET Core features such as **dependency injection**, configuration, routing, and data persistence.
  3. Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms in .NET Core Web APIs, including **middleware, filters**, token-based authentication (JWT) and role-based access control (RBAC), to secure API endpoints and manage user access.
  4. Design and implement a **functional programming solution in Typescript**, applying principles of pure functions, immutability, higher-order functions, function composition, polymorphism, advanced hierarchical data structures, recursion, currying, and closures to solve a complex problem.
  5. Develop **front-end components** and user interfaces using React.js library in TypeScript, applying component-based architecture principles, and leveraging React's lifecycle methods, state management, and props for building interactive and responsive UIs.
  6. Design and implement effective communication between front-end React components and back-end .NET Core Web APIs using asynchronous HTTP requests (fetch) and RESTful API conventions, ensuring efficient **data exchange**, error handling, and synchronization while adhering to best practices in client-server communication.

## 1. Course Description:

This course provides an in-depth exploration of web application development using .NET Core API and React in TypeScript. Students will learn to design, develop, and deploy full-stack web applications, gaining proficiency in both backend and frontend development technologies.


## 2. Course Organization:

2.1. **Theory and Live Coding Sessions:**
   - Regular sessions covering essential concepts and practical demonstrations for all student groups.

2.2. **Practical Labs:**
   - Structured lab sessions for hands-on practice and reinforcement of concepts.

2.3. **Project Development Hours:**
   - Dedicated time for supervised group project work.

2.4. **Supplementary Workshops:**
   - Additional sessions to address specific knowledge or skill gaps relevant to the project.

## 3. Course Assessment:

The course will be graded through two types of assessments: In order to get a grade the student need to have minimum passing grade i.e. >= 5.5 in each of assessment. A final grade will be average of both assessment if and only iff both actives are sufficient. 

e.g. Student Grade  = (Grade from Exam + Grade from Project ) / 2  
- Success scenario = e.g. Exam Grade = 7, Project Grade = 8 so the course grade is (7+8)/2 = 7.5 
- Failure scenarios: 
   * ND in both Exam & Project , final grade = ND
   * Exam Grade < 5.5 or ND , ..... final grade  = NVL (fail)
   * Project Grade < 5.5 or ND,  .... final grade  = NVL (fail) 

3.1. **Assessment Moments**
Apart from continuos feedback and data point collections, there will be two moments of summative assessments, a **mid term assessment** comprising of 30% of the total grade, and a **final term assessment** comprising of 70% of the total points. A **repair** work will be allowed for project part, and a **retake** will be available for exam part. 

3.2 **Exam**
   - Mid Term Exam:
      * When: In Week 6/7 
      * Coverage: Chapter 1 Backend  
      * Duration: 1 hour
      * Credit: 30 %  of Exam Grade
   - End Term Exam
      * When: In Week 16/17 
      * Coverage: Chapter 2 & 3 React, Typescript  
      * Duration: 2 hours
      * Credit: 70 %  of Exam Grade
   - Re-Take
      * Pre-Condition: if the course exam grade combined mid-term and end term exam is less than 5.5/10 then the students is required to re-take the exam.
      * When: In Week 18/19 
      * Coverage: All chapters  
      * Duration: 2.5 hours
      * Credit: 100 %  of Exam Grade

3.3  **Project Assessment**
The project assessment will comprise of assessment of the quality of the product and student's individual contribution. The product will be evaluated based on the [rubric](rubric.md). and individual contribution maybe decided based on assessor(s) judgment of the student's understanding, contribution
   - API part:
      * When: In Week 6/7 
      * Coverage: Implementation of backend  
      * Credit: 30 %  of Project Grade
   - Complete Project
      * When: In Week 16/17 
      * Coverage: React part, and communication with the backend  
      * Credit: 70 %  of Project Grade
   - Repair
      * Pre-Condition: if the project grade combined mid-term and end term exam is less than 5.5/10 then the student will be required to to do the repair work in order to get the grade, the repair work will be suggested by the project assessor(s) and could differ for individual student or project.
      * When: In Week 18/19 
      * Coverage: Full or Part of the project. 
      * Credit: will be decided by the assessor(s)


3.4. **Project:** 
   - The case: Building a minimum viable web application based on given case studies.
   - The group: The formation of the group will be fixed where a group may comprise of max 4 number of students. It is highly recommended to have same group in parallel course offered in the semester.  
   - The Evaluation: The project/ product will be evaluated based on the given rubric. where as the individual contribution will also be assessed an Individual might get +/- grade from their peers working in group. In extreme cases one my get an ND if one is not contributing constructively.
   - Here you may find project cases, such as [Office Calendar and Event Application](Project%20Ideas/Office%20Calendar/Description.md) and [Theater Reservation](Project%20Ideas/Theater%20Reservation/Description.md)
